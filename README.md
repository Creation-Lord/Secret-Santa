# Secret-Santa
# Creates files to send to people so that everyone, including the sender, has no idea who is buying for who.

# I made this a few years ago as a simple python program that could create text files that could be easily emailed for organising a Secret Santa with my family.
# The point of this is that everyone, including the sender, will not know who anyone else is buying for. Since the text files tell you who to send it to, you can previde the information without needign to know it yourself.
# This also means you have a record of who everyone should be buying for incase there is any problems
